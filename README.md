# 📘 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave the service or not) using **machine learning models**.  
Dataset used: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  

## 🛠️ Steps in the Project  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Handling Imbalance with SMOTE  
4. Model Training (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
6. Saving Best Model with Pickle  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are most likely to churn.  
- **Low tenure** customers churn more than loyal ones.  
- **High monthly charges** increase churn probability.  
- **Electronic check** payment method has highest churn rate.  

## 🧠 Best Model  
- **Random Forest Classifier** gave the best performance with high recall for churn class.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- Python, Pandas, Numpy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA)  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn (ML)  
- Google Colab
